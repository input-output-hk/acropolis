Pointers cache
--------------

Option `build-pointer-address-cache` has three possible options:
`never`, `always` and `if_absent`

I believe that `if_absent` is the best possible setting for it.

Chain id
--------

Need to know chain id --- to properly work with cached pointer parameters.
Probably, system-wide parameters should be implemented and used.
